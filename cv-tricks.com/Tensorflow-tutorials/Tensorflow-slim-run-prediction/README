Before you run this code, you need to download the pretrained models. 
Go to slim-pretrained folder and run these scripts: 

sh download_extract_v1.sh
Above will download inception_v1 model and extract it. You should have inception_v1.ckpt file in slim-pretrained folder after this.


sh download_extract_v3.sh

Above will download inception_v3 model and extract it. You should have inception_v3.ckpt file in slim-pretrained folder after this.


You can now run prediction on any image url like this: 

python run_inference_on_v1.py https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B5B9ZsvIgAATiC6.jpg


python run_inference_on_v3.py https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B5B9ZsvIgAATiC6.jpg
