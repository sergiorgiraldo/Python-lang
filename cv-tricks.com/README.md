# Tensorflow tutorials: 

#1 10 minutes Practical TensorFlow lesson for quick learners: If you have just heard about Tensorflow and are looking to get started, then go to this blog post http://cv-tricks.com/artificial-intelligence/deep-learning/deep-learning-frameworks/tensorflow-tutorial/ and in the end we train a simple linear classifier to absorb what we have studied. Code is here https://github.com/sankit1/cv-tricks.com/tree/master/Tensorflow-tutorials/first_tutorial

#2 Build image classifier using Tensorflow: In this blogpost http://cv-tricks.com/tensorflow-tutorial/training-convolutional-neural-network-for-image-classification/ , We build a simple convolutional neural network using Tensorflow. Code is here: https://github.com/sankit1/cv-tricks.com/tree/master/Tensorflow-tutorials/tutorial-2-image-classifier.
